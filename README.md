# pktpy -- pocketpy Max/MSP external

This is a Max/MSP external which aims to wrap a subset of the Max c-api using pocketpy.

[pocketpy](https://github.com/pocketpy/pocketpy) is a portable Python 3.x interpreter, written in C11. It aims to be an alternative to Lua for game scripting, with elegant syntax, powerful features and competitive performance. pocketpy has no dependencies other than the C standard library, which can be easily integrated into C/C++ projects. Developers are able to write Python bindings via C-API or pybind11 compatible interfaces.
